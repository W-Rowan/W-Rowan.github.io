Welcome! I am a PhD student in the [Vision, Graphics, and Learning Group](https://sites.google.com/york.ac.uk/vglyork/home) at the [University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk), working with [Nick Pears](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/people/?group=Academic%20and%20Teaching%20Staff&username=nep), [Patrik Huber](https://www.patrikhuber.ch), and [Andrew Keeling](https://medicinehealth.leeds.ac.uk/dentistry/staff/492/professor-andrew-keeling). Prior to my PhD, I graduated from the University of York in 2020 with BEng and MSc degrees in Computer Science.

My research is in computer vision and its applications to 3D shape understanding. I'm particularly interested in methods for understanding, analysing, and representing the human face. This includes statistical representations such as the 3D Morphable Model (3DMM), text-based initialisation of 3D head shape, and conditioned image generation from 3D shape.

My publications can be found [here](/publications/) and my CV [here](/cv/).
